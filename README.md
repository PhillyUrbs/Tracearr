Tracearr is a streaming access manager for **Plex** and **Jellyfin** that answers one question: *Who's actually using my server, and are they sharing their login?*

Unlike monitoring tools that just show you data, Tracearr is built to detect account abuse. See streams in real-time, flag suspicious activity automatically, and get notified the moment something looks off.

## What It Does

**Session Tracking** — Full history of who watched what, when, from where, on what device. Every stream logged with geolocation data.

**Sharing Detection** — Five rule types catch account sharers:
- 🚀 **Impossible Travel** — NYC then London 30 minutes later? That's not one person.
- 📍 **Simultaneous Locations** — Same account streaming from two cities at once.
- 🔀 **Device Velocity** — Too many unique IPs in a short window signals shared credentials.
- 📺 **Concurrent Streams** — Set limits per user. Simple but effective.
- 🌍 **Geo Restrictions** — Block streaming from specific countries entirely.

**Real-Time Alerts** — Discord webhooks and custom notifications fire instantly when rules trigger. No waiting for daily reports.

**Stream Map** — Visualize where your streams originate on an interactive world map. See the problem at a glance.

**Trust Scores** — Users earn (or lose) trust based on their behavior. Violations drop scores automatically.

**Multi-Server** — Connect Plex and Jellyfin instances to the same dashboard. Manage everything in one place.

## What It Doesn't Do (Yet)

Tracearr v1 is focused on **detection and alerting**. Automated enforcement—killing streams, suspending accounts—is coming in future versions. For now, you see the problems; you decide the action.

## Why Not Tautulli?

[Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) is great monitoring software. We use Highcharts for graphs too. But Tautulli shows you what happened—it doesn't tell you when something's wrong.

| | Tautulli | Tracearr |
|---|---|---|
| Watch history | ✅ | ✅ |
| Statistics & graphs | ✅ | ✅ |
| Account sharing detection | ❌ | ✅ |
| Impossible travel alerts | ❌ | ✅ |
| Trust scoring | ❌ | ✅ |
| Jellyfin support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Multi-server dashboard | ❌ | ✅ |

If you just want to see stats, Tautulli works fine. If you're tired of your brother's roommate's cousin streaming on your dime, that's what Tracearr is for.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/connorgallopo/Tracearr.git
cd Tracearr

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and connect your Plex or Jellyfin server.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires pnpm 9+, Node.js 20+)
pnpm install

# Start database services
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Run migrations
pnpm --filter @tracearr/server db:migrate

# Start dev servers
pnpm dev
```

Frontend runs at `localhost:5173`, API at `localhost:3000`.

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=32-byte-hex-key

# GeoIP (optional, for location detection)
MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY=your-maxmind-key
```
